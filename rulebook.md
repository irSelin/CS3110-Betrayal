## Object of the Game
Explore the house and make your character stronger until the "haunt" scenario begins. After that, your goal is to complete your side's victory condition first, either as a traitor or a hero.

## Setup
Set aside the Traitor's Tome and Secrets of Survival haunt books. You'll use them after the haunt is revealed.

Each player chooses a character card. There's a different explorer on each side of a character card. Pick one.
Attach 4 plastic clips to your explorer card. Each one should point to one of the explorer's GREEN starting numbers for his or her Speed, Might, Knowledge, and Sanity.

Shuffl e a stack of omen cards and put it facedown where everyone can reach it. Do the same with the item cards and the event cards.

Find the Basement Landing, Entrance Hall/Foyer/ Grand Staircase, and Upper Landing room tiles. Place them from left to right reasonably far apart.
Mix all of the rest of the room tiles together and put them facedown in a stack. (Don't worry about which floor is shown on the back of the tiles).

Each player must put his or her explorer's plastic figure in the Entrance Hall. (Each explorer's figure matches the color behind an explorer's picture on his or her character card).

Put the dice in a pile within easy reach. You'll need them throughout the game.

See who goes first. The explorer who has the next birthday goes first. (Look on your explorer's character card to see his or her birthday). Players take turns clockwise following the first explorer.

After setup, the table should look something like this:

## Game Play
Starting with the first player and going clockwise, each player takes a turn exploring the house.

On your turn, you can do as many of the following actions as you want, in any order:

 - Move
 -  Discover a new room
 - Attempt a die roll
 - Use item or omen cards
 - Attack (once during your turn after the haunt starts)

## Moving
On your explorer's turn, you can move up to number of spaces equal to your character's current Speed. Whenever a game effect makes you draw a card, you must STOP moving for the rest of your turn.

## Discovering a New Room
When your explorer enters a doorway, and there isn't a room on the other side, look at the top tile on the room stack. If it has the name of the floor you are on (ground floor, basement, or upper floor), turn it over and connect it to the doorway you just entered. Then move into that room. Add each new tile as logically as you can, creating adjacent rooms with connecting doors.

(Connect doorways whenever possible).

If the top tile can't go on the floor you're currently on, set it aside facedown in a discard pile. Keep setting tiles aside until you find one that works on your floor. (Some tiles work on more than one floor).

An explorer can move through a door if it connects to another door in an adjacent room. Doors are always open. The one exception is the front door. It's always locked. You can't leave the house or use the front door unless a haunt says otherwise. (Outside rooms like the Patio are still part of the house).

Staircases connect floors. The Grand Staircase always connects to the Upper Landing. The Stairs from Basement always lead to and from the Foyer through a secret door. (You can't use the Stairs from Basement until you discover that room in the basement).

Some rooms also have rules on them, which apply to your explorer each time you enter the room. Some rooms affect movement. A few rooms are clarifi ed in the "Special Rooms" sidebar.

## Drawing Omen, Item, & Event Cards
A room may have a card symbol on it. The first time you discover a room with a card symbol, you must end your move in that room and draw the appropriate card.

If the room has a spiral symbol , draw an event card. Read it out loud. Follow its instructions, which may require you to attempt rolls. Then discard the card unless it says otherwise or has an ongoing effect.

If the room has a bull's head symbol , draw an item card. Read it out loud. Place it face up in front of you; you now have it in your possession. You may use it once immediately and once on each of your turns, unless it says otherwise.

If the room has a raven symbol , draw an omen card. Read it out loud. Place it face up in front of you; you now have it in your possession. You might have to do something immediately.

At the end of your turn, you must make a haunt roll.


## Special Rooms
Many room tiles have rules printed on them, but some of them also have special rules, listed here.

### The Entrance Hall
The Entrance Hall, Foyer, and Grand Staircase are all on the same room tile, but they count as three separate rooms.

### The Mystic Elevator
This tile moves as soon as you enter it. Roll 2 dice and put it adjacent to a connecting door on the appropriate floor. (If there isn't one, leave the Mystic Elevator where it is).

If you roll the same floor, you can move the elevator to a different connecting door on your floor. You can use the elevator only once a turn.

### The Coal Chute
Entering the Coal Chute and moving to the Basement Landing counts as one space of movement. A turn can't end with an explorer or monster on the Coal Chute space. (That figure will always slide down to the Basement Landing).

### The Vault
### The Collapsed Room
### The Crypt
### The Furnace Room
### The Chasm, Catacombs, Vault, & Tower

## Using Items & Omen Cards
